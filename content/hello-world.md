```cpp
int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
}
```

hello, world

the very first code that we all write. simple, uncomplicated, and straight to the point. reminds one where
they once were, back when it was all newâ€”when we typed those words, hit "run," and the magic came alive.
it felt like inventing something new, even though you just told the computer to yell at you.

and now, here i am again, taking a step back, not just to the basics of code but to the basics of me.
these past few weeks have been a bit like a "reset" button. life has thrown a few exceptions that i wasn't 
able to catch (pun intended, java devs) and i find myself staring at a blank screen again trying to 
figure out where to go from here.

this blog i write forms part of my attempt to hit "compile" once again. i'm not reinvinting the wheel here,
rather, it's a solitary gesture at reconnecting with myself. after all, even the most complex programs
start with a simple hello.

so, here i am. refactoring those lines, one small step at a time.
